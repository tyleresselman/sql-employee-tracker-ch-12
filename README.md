  # MYSQL Employee Tracker App - Challenge 12

  ## Description: 
  Our assignment this module was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. I was successful getting the structure of the app solidified and several functions to work, though I have a few to revisit to achieve full functionality.
